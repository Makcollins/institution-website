        <p> St. Anselm’s School Ajmer was founded by the French Capuchin missionaries in 1904. The French Christian Missionaries were concerned about the education of the young boys. It was then, the Rev. Fortunatus Henri Camaunt, the Perfect Apostolic decided to start St. Anselm’s initially as a Boarding school, which then later became a Day school. Now, St. Anselm’s Senior Secondary School is an unaided Christian Minority Institution run by the Ajmer Diocesan Clergy. The School has obtained the Minority Certificate from the Government.
        The Roman Catholic Diocesan Education Society runs a chain of schools all over Rajasthan. The schools are mainly dedicated to the care of St. Anselm or St. Paul. St. Anselm’s Ajmer is the Mother Institution of all the Catholic Schools in Rajasthan.</p>

                    <p>St. Anselm came from a noble Lombard family and was born in Aosta in the Italian Alps. His mother was a good and pious Burgundian woman, but after her death, his father’s violence and harshness finally caused Anselm to flee to France. Here after several years of wandering he took the Benedictine habit in 1060 at Bec (Normandy), where his illustrious countryman Blessed Lanfranc had started the famous school and soon he was outstanding for his learning. Within a span of three years, he was made Prior and after another 15 years, despite his reluctance, Abbot.</p>
                    <br><p>As Abbot St. Anselm had to cross over to England from time to time in connection with his abbey’s English properties, and there he became known and highly esteemed for his virtues and fearless zeal. So much so that in 1099 he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in the hope that he would be able cope with the encroachments of King William, the Red.</p>
                    <br><p>Gentle and self-effacing by nature, St. Anselm was unyielding on matters of principle. A man of fearless zeal, he strongly denounced the slave trade and staunchly defended the Filioque (“and from the Son”), a doctrine that indicated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son.</p>
                    <br><p>Many important writings of this gentle Prelate, who was considered the greatest intellectual of his age and a ‘pattern for all theologians’, were composed during his two banishments. They earned him the title of ‘Father of Scholasticism’ and ‘Doctor of the Universal Church’ (1720) on account of the deep and lasting influence which his thinking has had upon philosophy and theology.</p>

                  <h2>Our School Crest</h2>
                  <p> St. Anselm: The Central Figure is of St. Anselm,the Patron of the school. He is shown in the attire of a bishop with an open book in his hands. St. Anselm besides being one of the most illustrious Archbishops to occupy the See of Canterbury was a renowned Philosopher and Doctor of the Church keenly interested in the Education of Youth.</p>
                  <br><br><p> The Franciscan Coat-Of-arms: To the right of St. Anselm, you find in the Franciscan Coat-of-arms i.e. the hand of Christ crosses the hand of Francis, with the cross standing between. The emblem is to remind us that the Institution was Founded by the Franciscan Fathers of the Capuchin Order and of the traditions they have established.</p>
                  <br><br><p> The Ashoka Wheel:  On the left of St. Anselm lies the Ashoka Wheel, denoting that with the advent of Independence the College had been entrusted to the sons of the soil, the Secular Clergy.</p>
                  <br><br><p> Our Lady:  The top portion of the Shield bears the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Immaculate Conception), denoted by the letters I and C on either side. The picture is a reproduction of the beautiful stain window of the adjoining Cathedral, under the shadow of which the Institution has grown to its present stature. The background of deep blue,denoted by the horizontal lines together with the white of the lower half form the School Colours - Blue and White.</p>
                  <br><br><p> The Motto: Beneath runs the School Motto:  "Deo Amabiles et Hominibus". It means pleasing to God and to men. Such is also the aim and purpose of St. Anselm's.</p>
                  <br><br><p> The Supporting Animals: The shield is supported by a unicorn on the right and a lion on the left to remind us of the singleness of purpose in achieving our ideals and the Courage to live up to them.</p>
                  <br><br><p> The Star: The star surmounting the crest reminds us that the school is situated at the foot of the mighty "Taragarh" the "Fort of the Star", the famous "Garh Beetli" of Rajput poems and closely connected with the immortal Prithvi Raj. The mountain raises its rugged  summit rigid above the School. The star also suggests to us that  star which long ago led the Kings  of the East to the Knowledge of the one true God. May St. Anselm's school serve the same purpose.</p>
