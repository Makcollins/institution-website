        <p> St. Anselm’s Sr. Sec. School, Ajmer is an English Medium Co- educational Minority institution;<br>
          which provides a strong educational foundation designed to fit its students for the world of tomorrow.<br>
           St. Anselm's School has been innovative and in the forefront of education since its foundation in 1904.<br><br>

          “If a plant is carefully nurtured by a gardener, it will become good, and produce better fruit.<br>
           Therefore, children must be given a good training from their earliest childhood.”.<br><br>

          We try to create an atmosphere of reverence for education and a healthy environment where academics, sports and co-curricular facilities mould our students and motivate them to be the brightest and the best.<br>

          Parents, students and the school authorities are a team and complement each other's efforts. Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job but a lifelong process which creates an understanding of moral and ethical values to guide one's life and make our students the future hope of the country.</p>
